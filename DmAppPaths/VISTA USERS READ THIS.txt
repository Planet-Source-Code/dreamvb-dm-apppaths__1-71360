This is for vista users, If you find you have problems using this program it down to vista’s security in the registry. That stops for writing keys, however there is a small trick.

Goto start->Run and type regedit press [enter]

Locate the key in the registry 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths

Now you need to set permissions for this key so right click the key AppPaths
And select permissions from the list select the item in the list something like

Users(Local\Users)

In the box just below select the check the tick for full control and click apply and then OK
You should then have no problems, you can also disable it by checking of if needed.
